# Inventory-System-GUI
### This program creates a GUI to emulate a store account system where customers and employees can login and use the GUI various functions.
The Store_GUI file creates the account page where a user can login with vaild credentials. If the user is a customer, the user is taken to the store page where they are able to search for products by store, buy and rent items, and check them out of the store. If the user is an employee, the user is taken to the inventory modification page where they can add, delete, and return rental items to the store's inventories. This program was a group project created by myself and two other students attending the same class.
